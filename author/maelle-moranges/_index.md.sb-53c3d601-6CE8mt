#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the #significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural #networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; #and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can #act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to #OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions #that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Bio

I am interested in the contribution of artificial intelligence to medicine to better understand and model cognitive and biological mechanisms. Specializing in neuroinformatics and bioinformatics, I leverage machine learning and data mining to address these challenges.
