## üéì Leveraging AI to Enhance Educational Practices: The TUPAIA Chair

### üî¨ **Role:**
Researcher collaborating with LaRAC under the TUPAIA Chair at MIAI Grenoble Alpes

### üí∞ **Funding:**
This project is supported by the **MIAI Grenoble Alpes Institute** under the TUPAIA Chair (Technologies Used in Pedagogy with Artificial Intelligence Adaptations). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## üéØ **Scientific and Technological Objectives**

The **TUPAIA Chair** aims to integrate artificial intelligence into educational practices to:

1. **Enhance Personalized Learning:** Adapt educational content to individual learner characteristics by considering cognitive variables such as motivation, cognitive load, and satisfaction.
2. **Improve Acceptability of AI-Powered Tools:** Investigate factors influencing the acceptance of AI-driven educational tools among users, including teachers and students, to ensure effective implementation. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## üîç **Research Projects**

### **1. Impact of Note-Taking and Breaks on Cognitive Load**

**Collaborator:** *Mathieu Pinelli*

**Objective:** Examine how note-taking strategies and scheduled breaks affect learners' cognitive load during video-based learning sessions.

**Methodology:**

- **Subgroup Discovery (SD):** Identify patterns in how different note-taking methods influence cognitive load.
- **Gradual Pattern Analysis:** Analyze the progressive impact of breaks on learning efficiency.

**Outcomes:** Insights into optimizing instructional designs to manage cognitive load effectively.

### **2. Personalized Video Recommendations Using Reinforcement Learning**

**Collaborator:** *Nassim Bouarour*

**Objective:** Develop a system that provides personalized video content recommendations based on individual learner profiles, focusing on cognitive load and skill levels.

**Methodology:**

- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Implement reinforcement learning techniques to tailor video recommendations that align with learners' cognitive states and competencies.

**Outcomes:** Creation of adaptive learning environments that enhance engagement and knowledge retention.

## üß© **Collaborations**

- **LaRAC (Laboratoire de Recherche sur les Apprentissages en Contexte):** A multidisciplinary research laboratory specializing in educational sciences, focusing on understanding learning processes in various contexts. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## üì¢ **Dissemination**

- **Ongoing Experiments:** Conducting student experiments to gather data for assessing the impact of AI-driven educational tools.
- **Publications:** Preparing research articles detailing methodologies and findings for submission to peer-reviewed educational and AI journals.
